# HoloServer â˜•ðŸ–¥âš™ðŸ¥½
The server receives a request from Hololens 2 and responds with the 3D model to the client (Hololens). 
Once Hololens 2 has successfully detected the object in the real environment, it queries the server to obtain the 3D model along with all relevant information and details. 
Finally, after receiving the server's response, it presents the visual content to the end-user.
